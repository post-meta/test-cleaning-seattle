            Advantages of DIY Cleaning
          </h3>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">Cost Savings</h4>
            <p className="text-green-700">
              The most obvious benefit of DIY cleaning is the money you'll save. With professional cleaning services in Seattle ranging from $100-$300 per visit, doing it yourself can result in significant annual savings, especially for regular maintenance cleaning.

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">Complete Control</h4>
            <p className="text-blue-700">
              When you clean your own space, you have total control over the products used, areas prioritized, and level of attention given to specific spots. This is particularly valuable for those with allergies, chemical sensitivities, or specific cleaning preferences.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-800 mb-3">Flexible Scheduling</h4>
            <p className="text-purple-700">
              DIY cleaning allows you to clean on your own schedule, whether that's early morning, late evening, or weekend sessions. There's no need to coordinate with service providers or work around their availability.

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <li><strong>Time Investment:</strong> Thorough cleaning takes considerable time – often 3-6 hours for a typical Seattle home, time that could be spent on work, family, or leisure activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Demands:</strong> Deep cleaning is physically exhausting, involving heavy lifting, repetitive motions, and awkward positions that can lead to fatigue or injury.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Expertise:</strong> Without professional training, you might miss problem areas, use incorrect techniques, or fail to address issues like mold, deep stains, or pest problems effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Equipment Limitations:</strong> Professional-grade equipment like commercial vacuums, steam cleaners, and specialized tools are expensive to purchase and maintain for occasional use.</li>
            <li><strong>Inconsistent Results:</strong> Energy levels, motivation, and available time vary, leading to inconsistent cleaning quality from session to session.</li>

            <li><strong>Trust and Security Concerns:</strong> Allowing strangers into your home requires trust and may raise security concerns for some homeowners.</li>
            <li><strong>Less Personal Control:</strong> You may have less say in specific products used or particular attention given to certain areas unless clearly communicated.</li>
            <li><strong>Potential for Inconsistency:</strong> Different team members or high staff turnover can lead to varying quality levels between cleaning sessions.</li>
