                The first and most important factor when selecting a cleaning service in Seattle is ensuring they are properly licensed and insured. Washington state requires cleaning services to have a business license, and reputable companies should carry both liability insurance and workers' compensation insurance.

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li>Verify their business license through the Washington State Department of Revenue</li>

                <li>Confirm they have workers' compensation coverage</li>
