          <div className="mb-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-4">The Pacific Northwest Climate Factor</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Washington State's climate creates specific cleaning challenges that residents in other regions rarely face. The high humidity levels, particularly in western Washington, create ideal conditions for mold and mildew growth. Our extensive rainy season, which typically runs from October through May, means constant moisture that can penetrate homes and create persistent cleaning issues.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              During our cleaning services throughout Seattle and surrounding areas, we've observed that homes require more frequent attention to moisture-related problems. Bathrooms, basements, and poorly ventilated areas are particularly susceptible to these issues, requiring specialized cleaning products and techniques that work effectively in high-humidity environments.

          <div className="mb-6">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-4">Seasonal Cleaning Considerations</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Each season in Washington brings distinct cleaning challenges. Spring cleaning in WA isn't just about decluttering—it's about addressing the moisture damage and mold growth that may have developed during our wet winter months. Summer brings wildfire smoke from both local and distant fires, requiring air quality management and specialized cleaning of surfaces that have been exposed to smoke particles.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Fall preparation involves getting homes ready for the upcoming rainy season, which includes deep cleaning gutters, checking for leaks, and ensuring proper ventilation systems are clean and functional. Winter cleaning focuses on managing the constant moisture and mud that gets tracked into homes during our wettest months.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-4">Kitchen Cleaning in High-Humidity Environments</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Washington kitchens require extra attention to prevent moisture buildup and the resulting mold and mildew issues. Start by ensuring proper ventilation during and after cooking. Your range hood should be used every time you cook, and windows should be opened when weather permits to allow air circulation.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Clean and sanitize all surfaces daily with antimicrobial cleaners specifically designed for high-humidity environments</li>
              <li>Pay special attention to areas around the sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator where moisture tends to accumulate</li>
              <li>Regularly clean behind appliances where moisture can create hidden mold growth</li>
              <li>Use dehumidifiers in kitchens that don't have adequate natural ventilation</li>
              <li>Clean and replace refrigerator water filters more frequently due to potential sediment from Pacific Northwest water sources</li>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-4">Bathroom Maintenance and Mold Prevention</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Bathrooms in Washington homes face constant moisture challenges. The key to maintaining clean, healthy bathrooms lies in both regular cleaning and preventive measures that address our region's specific humidity issues.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Install and regularly use exhaust fans rated for your bathroom size</li>
              <li>Clean tile grout weekly with anti-fungal cleaners to prevent mold establishment</li>
              <li>Seal grout lines annually to prevent moisture penetration</li>
              <li>Use daily shower sprays designed for high-humidity climates</li>
              <li>Keep bathroom doors open when not in use to promote air circulation</li>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-800 mb-4">Living Areas and Carpet Care</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Living spaces in Washington homes deal with unique challenges including tracked-in mud during rainy months and potential smoke exposure during fire season. Carpet care is particularly important as our climate can cause carpets to retain moisture and develop odors or mold if not properly maintained.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Vacuum high-traffic areas daily during mud season (typically November through March)</li>
              <li>Use entrance mats both inside and outside doors to minimize tracked-in debris</li>
              <li>Schedule professional carpet cleaning every 6-8 months rather than the typical annual cleaning</li>
              <li>Use air purifiers during wildfire season to reduce smoke particle buildup</li>
              <li>Clean upholstery regularly with fabric-appropriate cleaners that address moisture and odor issues</li>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Basements and lower-level areas in Washington homes are particularly vulnerable to moisture issues. These spaces require proactive cleaning and maintenance to prevent serious mold and mildew problems that can affect the entire home's air quality.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Run dehumidifiers year-round in basements, maintaining humidity levels below 50%</li>
              <li>Inspect for water intrusion monthly, particularly during heavy rain periods</li>
              <li>Clean and disinfect basement floors weekly with anti-microbial solutions</li>
              <li>Ensure proper ventilation and consider installing exhaust fans in windowless basements</li>
